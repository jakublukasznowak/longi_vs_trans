# longi_vs_trans

This code was written by Jakub L. Nowak for the analysis of the transverse-to-longitudinal ratio of 2nd order turbulent velocity statistics (structure functions and power spectra) derived from aircraft measurements.

There are 4 field experiments and 3 aircrafts sampling 2 marine boundary layer regimes included:
- EUREC4A - ATR42 aircraft - shallow trade-wind convection
- RICO - C130 aircraft - shallow trade-wind convection
- VOCALS-REx - C130 aircraft - subtropical stratocumulus
- POST - Twin Otter aircraft - subtropical stratocumulus

The analysis requires access to the datasets which can be downloaded from the public data repositories.

MYPROJECTPATH is the location where you downloaded the codes.
MYDATAPATH is the path where you downloaded the datasets:
